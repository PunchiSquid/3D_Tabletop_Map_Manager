# Project Vision
The project is a three-dimensional grid-based virtual mapping tool for managing a table-top role-playing game.  

The tool will allow a user to design, view and distribute a fully traversable 3D map to players over a network, where they will be able to view the active session in real-time through a player view with more limited functionality, allowing them to move their characters.
The system will track multiple game mechanics in real-time, including; the locations of both player and non-player characters, the sight ranges of player characters, the radii of environmental effects, (spells, elemental attacks, etc.) and the ‘initiative’ values of characters.  
As well as this, the system will display projected routes for players as they choose a space on the grid to move towards.
The game master will be able to make minor changes to the map in real-time, as well as revealing hidden areas of the map to dynamically display sections to players in the active session.

The project was chosen in response to a shared frustration between myself and my regular group of players. It can be difficult to track conflicts that take place with multiple characters in larger areas, a problem partially addressed by existing services, though each coming with its own drawbacks. The chosen project was conceptualised as an improvement on these existing systems, providing a map with support for elevation and multi-level environment design, as well as providing an enhanced sense of immersion through the use of 3D elements and dynamic sight ranges.
